# UIE_survey

In fact, we don't know what we're doing. A project that is trying to collaborate on underwater image enhancement.
We want to classify the papers according to some rule
We hope every single article has an abstract in one sentence, including function, database, GT, appearance and so on.
Articles shall be in recent 3 years to keep up with the advanced feature.

## (2019) Natural-based underwater image color enhancement through fusion of swarm-intelligence algorithm
  
  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105810
  
  Method: Natural-based underwater image color enhancement (NUCE)

  Highlights
    • The proposed natural-based underwater image color enhancement enhances contrast and color.
    • Proposed NUCE method superimposes color cast neutralization, dual image fusion, and mean equalization steps.
    • The output images produce significant contrast and color while outstandingly addressing blue–green color cast.
    • Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show better improvement of the addressed problems.
